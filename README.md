## Abstract:

An American firm called Airbnb, runs an online marketplace for travel-related services and accommodations, especially home stays for holiday rentals. Our objective is to evaluate the dataset and derive various conclusions based on pricing, neighborhood, and crowd.

## Description of the dataset:
There are 48895 rows and 16 columns in our dataset. There are several null values that I have fixed.

## Data cleaning:
We deleted the null values from the dataset before filtering it according to our needs. Our dataset contains null values, which may interfere with our accuracy therefore I removed them at the start of my project to achieve a better outcome. Then I saw the description of the data and found an outlier on the minimum night column, so swapped the outliers with the 95 percentile quantile value of minimum night column.
## Problem statements:
**1. What can we know about different hosts and areas?**


**2. What can we know from locations, prices, reviews, etc?**


**3.  Which hosts are the busiest and why?**


**4.  Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?**


 

## Conclusions:

 People prefer to stay in cheaper accommodations.  If you are looking for cheaper stays then it is recommended to not travel to Bronx in the month of April and Queens in the month of October. 

 June and July are the busiest months.

 Home apartment and Private rooms are most preferred room type. 

 Brooklyn and Manhattan experiences highest traffic. This is because they are tourist place. The average price in also Brooklyn and Manhattan are higher as compared to other neighborhoods.

 Queens is the ideal destination for our client as a lot of Airbnbs with reviews are available there that fills his criteria
